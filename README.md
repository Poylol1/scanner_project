A project for the mesa 2025 NEDC competition. If this goes correctly the 
necessary models and instructions to build the machine should be at ./instructions/
You should only install the project and in your raspberry pi and pay attention for
the setup, then build it. Instructions will be placed later. Until then. HELLO

Dependencies:
    Tesseract-ocr
    libtesseract-libs
```
    I kinda expect for a headless browser to become a dependency soon
```
